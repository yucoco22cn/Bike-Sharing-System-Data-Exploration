### Questions be answered
- When are most trips taken in terms of time of day, day of the week, or month of the year?
- How long does the average trip take?
- Does the above depend on if a user is a subscriber or customer?
- Does the above depend on the age of the customer?



### Major Findings
- First, I find the number of bike trips is affacted by the season, day of week and hours in a day. The peak time of using the system is in summer, during weekday and in the morning (7:00-9:00) and afternoon (16:00-18:00) of a day.<br>
- Second, I find the bike trips are various based on different customer type. Customers use the bike sharing system more often on weekends,Subscribers use the bike sharing system mainly on weekdays.<br>
- Finally, I observed tht the renting behaviour is also different among different age groups. For the customer, young people (18-29) are more likely to use the system on the weekend compared with other age groups. For the subscriber, mid-age people use the system more to commute.
